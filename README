This is my .fvwm2rc configuration file which I use, with fvwm2, for
my home desktop.

To use, copy over ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

the wallpaper.sh script is the script I use to mess with my wallpaper.
I have it reside in a folder I created called ~/.scripts/ where I place
all my custom scripts. I call the script at startup in my .xinitrc and 
have the 'change wallpaper' button refer to it.
